# Contributing
 
First off, thank you for considering contributing to Confluence Protractor Base.
 
## 1. Where do I go from here?
 
If you've noticed a bug or have a question,
[search the issue tracker](https://github.com/seibert-media/confluence-protractor-base/issues?q=something)
to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket.
If not, go ahead and [make one](https://github.com/seibert-media/confluence-protractor-base/issues/new)!
 
## 2. Fork & create a branch
 
If this is something you think you can fix, then
[fork Confluence Protractor Base](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
and create a branch with a descriptive name.
 
A good branch name would be (where issue #123 is the ticket you're working on):
 
```sh
git checkout -b feature/123-what-is-the-branch-about
```
 
Implement your changes and fixes!
